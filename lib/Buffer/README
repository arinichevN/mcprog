This module is intended to minimize dynamic memory allocation system calls. If calls for more memory are too often, it increases size of memory block allocated by single system call. This module can only allocate system memory but never free. When client wants to free memory for some object, this module only marks it as free and may return it to client back on other allocation requests.
